    <h2 class="About"> About Us </h2>
      <img class="beauty" src="beauty1.jpg" alt="beauty" /> 
    <p class="Question"> B &amp; A Glow Essentials started as a very small company with the desire to make quality skin products that are simple, safe, refreshing, nourishing, and sustainable for all skin tones. This company came to existence through the collaboration of few beauty enthusiasts, who noticed a gap in the production of quality skincare products in the market. We experienced a lot of challenges while trying to make this organization what it is today, but through dedication, discipline, resilience, hardwork, determination and the grace of God, we overcomed them.  We worked together to create the most efficient and advanced skincare products for our lovely customers in a bid to improve the cleanliness, health, and appearance of the skin and we are glad we have been able to achieve that, seeing the feedbacks our customers have been given. </p>

    <h4 class="Q"> Why B &amp; A Glow Essentials? </h4>
      
    <p class="Question"> The question should be "Why not B &amp; A Glow Essentials." While there are millions of skincare product organizations, there are only a handful who are comprehensive and offer effective, non-toxic, clean, and quality skincare products for all skin types and B &amp; A Glow Essentials is certainly one of them. Our products are created with love and care, and powered by natural ingredients like aloe vera, rosewater, tumeric, and shea butter. We are committed to using ethically sourced ingredients and adhering to rigorous quality standards to deliver trustworthy products. I am very sure our beloved customers wouldn't want to miss out on this wonderful and amazing opportunity.</p>
